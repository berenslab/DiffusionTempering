# Diffusion Tempering Improves Parameter Estimation with Probabilistic Integrators for Ordinary Differential Equations

This is the code for reproducing the experiments from [Diffusion Tempering Improves Parameter Estimation with Probabilistic Integrators for Ordinary Differential Equations](https://openreview.net/forum?id=43HZG9zwaj).

The plots can be reproduced with the notebooks in `notebooks` and the [data](https://zenodo.org/records/11244700) or alternatively by running the experiments which are found in `scripts`.

To run the experiments you need to install julia version 1.9.4. Then from within the repository run the `julia` REPL. The packages can be installed using `] activate .` followed by `instantiate`.
